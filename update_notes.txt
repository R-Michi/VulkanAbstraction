    - The filter for searching a physical device does not include surface und swapchain capabilities anymore. Those checks are now separate
      and are found within the vka::surface and vka::swapchain namespace.
    - The names of the functions contained within the namespaces vka::instance, vka::device and vka::utility changed. Additionally, the
      return argument of the functions that search for multiple layers or extensions changed to a size_t (was a bool before). Therefore,
      the index argument was removed, which is now the return argument.
    - Previously, glfw was enabled by default. Now it is changed to disabled by default and you have to manually enable it by defining
      >> VKA_GLFW_ENABLE <<.
    - Patched, that you can also use the library without the additional use of tiny object loader. There was a bug, that you had to include
      the tiny object loader library (header file) only to be able to use the vka library. However, you can enable model loading, then you
      have to include the tiny object loader library, by defining >> VKA_MODEL_LOADING_ENABLE <<.
    - Patched the bug, that you werent able to use the library without including fstream externally. The compiler was then generating a lot
      of implicit definition errors.
    - Updated format_sizeof() to the newest vulkan version.

########################################################## version 1.4.0-dev2 update notes ##########################################################
    - Reworked the modules: "instance", "device", "surface", "swapchain", "queue", "utility", "attachment", "buffer" and "texture".
      NOTE: A lot of function arguments, return types and names of functions have changed (also including methods of classes).
    - Classes are now created with their own create infos instead of many setter functions.
    - Classes and other functions which have requiered a physical device, now requiere specific physical device properties.
    - There is now the option to only enable a certain feature with >> VKA_*_ENABLE << or also to include the respective library with
      >> VKA_INCLUDE_* <<. To include the library both >> VKA_*_ENABLE << and >> VKA_INCLUDE_* << must be defined. This also enables the
      option to externally incldue the requiered libraries and only enable the feature. (This was not possible before)
      There are 3 features this library supports:
        a) GLFW: >> VKA_GLFW_ENABLE << enables GLFW features, additionally >> VKA_INCLUDE_GLFW << includes GLFW. (glfw3 is requiered)
        b) Model loading: >> VKA_MODEL_LOADING_ENABLE << enables model loading features, additionally >> VKA_INCLUDE_TINYOBJ << includes
           the requiered library (the "tiny object loader" library is used for model loading).
        c) STB image: >> VKA_STB_IMAGE_LOAD_ENABLE << enables image loading features, additionally >> VKA_INCLUDE_STB_IMAGE << includes the
           requiered STB header files (only "stb_image.h" is included).
    - Now, this library supports image loading with the help of stb image. Functions of this feature are in the module "texture" as static
      members of the "Texture" class.
